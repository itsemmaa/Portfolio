		<p class="text">Throughout high school, I worked year-round as an all-star cheerleading coach at Gymnastics Unlimited. I worked with kids
			aged 3 through about 13 years old to help them develop skills in tumbling, stunting, jumps, and dance. I provided leadership in order to help them learn about winning and 
			losing gracefully, working as a team and what it means to be a good teammate, how to be disciplined, motivated, and safe. I coached practices on my own, created stunts and
			dances and taught them myself, led classes, taught private lessons, and led teams through competition days and showcases.</p>
